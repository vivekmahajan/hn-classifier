hn-classifier
=============
This will be chrome extension to improve hacker news browsing experience.

Motivation
----------
On hacker news the news are ranked based on users upvotes (karma etc), they are
not personalized. I am trying to build chrome extension which will train a classifier
based on user's interest(upvotes, comments etc) and will filter the stories
accordingly.
